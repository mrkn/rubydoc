#@since 1.8.0
= class XMLRPC::Client::Proxy < XMLRPC::Client

Class XMLRPC::Client::Proxy makes XML-RPC calls look nicer!

You can call any method onto objects of that class - the object handles
method_missing and will forward the method call to a XML-RPC server.
Don't use this class directly, but use instead method [[unknown:XMLRPC::Client#proxy]] or
[[m:XMLRPC::Client#proxy2]].

Every method call is forwarded to the XML-RPC server defined in [[m:XMLRPC::Client::Proxy#new]].

Note: Inherited methods from class Object cannot be used as XML-RPC names, because they get around
method_missing.

    require "xmlrpc/client"

    server = XMLRPC::Client.new("www.ruby-lang.org", "/RPC2", 80)

    michael  = server.proxy("michael")
    michael2 = server.proxy("michael", 4)

    # both calls should return the same value '9'.
    p michael.add(4,5)
    p michael2.add(5)


== Class Methods
--- new( server, prefix, args=[], meth=:call, delim="." )

Creates an object which provides method_missing.

server must be of type XMLRPC::Client, which is the XML-RPC server to be used
for a XML-RPC call. prefix and delim will be prepended to the methodname
called onto this object.

Parameter meth is the method (call, call2, call_async, call2_async) to use for
a RPC.

args are arguments which are automatically given
to every XML-RPC call before the arguments provides through method_missing.
