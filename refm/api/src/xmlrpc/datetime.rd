= class XMLRPC::DateTime < Object

This class is important to handle XMLRPC dateTime.iso8601 values,
correcly, because normal UNIX-dates (class Date) only handle dates
from year 1970 on, and class Time handles dates without the time
component. XMLRPC::DateTime is able to store a XMLRPC
dateTime.iso8601 value correctly.
