= class DRb::DRbUnknown < Object

Class wrapping a marshalled object whose type is unknown locally.

If an object is returned by a method invoked over drb, but the class
of the object is unknown in the client namespace, or the object is a
constant unknown in the client namespace, then the still-marshalled
object is returned wrapped in a DRbUnknown instance.

If this object is passed as an argument to a method invoked over drb,
then the wrapped object is passed instead.

The class or constant name of the object can be read from the name
attribute. The marshalled object is held in the buf attribute.

== Class Methods

--- new(err, buf)
#@todo

Create a new DRbUnknown object.

buf is a string containing a marshalled object that could not be
unmarshalled. err is the error message that was raised when the
unmarshalling failed. It is used to determine the name of the
unmarshalled object.

== Instance Methods

--- exception()
#@todo

Create a DRbUnknownError exception containing this object. 

--- reload()
#@todo

Attempt to load the wrapped marshalled object again.

If the class of the object is now known locally, the object will be
unmarshalled and returned. Otherwise, a new but identical DRbUnknown
object will be returned.

= class DRb::DRbUnknownError < DRb::DRbError

An exception wrapping a [[c:DRb::DRbUnknown]] object
