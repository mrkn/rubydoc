= module DRb::DRbProtocol

Module managing the underlying network protocol(s) used by drb.

By default, drb uses the [[c:DRbTCPSocket protocol]]. Other protocols can be defined. 

A new protocol is registered with the DRbProtocol module using the add_protocol method.

For examples of other protocols, see [[c:DRb::DRbUNIXSocket]] in [[lib:drb/unix]], and HTTP0 in sample/http0.rb and sample/http0serv.rb in the full drb distribution.

All of these methods should raise a [[c:DRb::DRbBadScheme]] error if
the URI does not identify the protocol they support (e.g. "druby:" for
the standard Ruby protocol). This is how the [[c:DRb::DRbProtocol]] module, given
a URI, determines which protocol implementation serves that protocol.

== Module Functions

--- add_protocol(prot)

Add a new protocol to the DRbProtocol module. 

A protocol must define the following class methods:

: open(uri, config)
 Open a client connection to the server at uri, using configuration config.  Return a protocol instance for this connection.

: open_server(uri, config)
 Open a server listening at uri, using configuration config.  Return a protocol instance for this listener.

: uri_option(uri, config)
 Take a URI, possibly containing an option component (e.g. a trailing '?param=val'), and return a [uri, option] tuple.

The DRbProtocol module asks each registered protocol in turn to try to open the URI. Each protocol signals that it does not handle that URI by raising a [[c:DRb::DRbBadScheme]] error. If no protocol recognises the URI, then a [[c:DRb::DRbBadURI]] error is raised. If a protocol accepts the URI, but an error occurs in opening it, a [[c:DRb::DRbConnError]] is raised.
==== open_server
The protocol instance returned by open_server must have the following methods:

: accept
 Accept a new connection to the server. Returns a protocol instance capable of communicating with the client. 

: close
 Close the server connection. 

: uri
 Get the URI for this server. 

==== open
The protocol instance returned by open must have the following methods:

: send_request (ref, msg_id, arg, b)
 Send a request to ref with the given message id and arguments. This is most easily implemented by calling DRbMessage.send_request, providing a stream that sits on top of the current protocol. 

: recv_reply
 Receive a reply from the server and return it as a [success-boolean, reply-value] pair. This is most easily implemented by calling DRb.recv_reply, providing a stream that sits on top of the current protocol. 

: alive?
 Is this connection still alive? 

: close
 Close this connection. 

==== open_server().accept()
The protocol instance returned by open_server().accept() must have the following methods:

: recv_request
 Receive a request from the client and return a [object, message, args, block] tuple. This is most easily implemented by calling DRbMessage.recv_request, providing a stream that sits on top of the current protocol. 

: send_reply(succ, result)
 Send a reply to the client. This is most easily implemented by calling DRbMessage.send_reply, providing a stream that sits on top of the current protocol. 

: close
 Close this connection. 

= class DRb::DRbConnError < DRb::DRbError

Error raised when an error occurs on the underlying communication protocol.

= class DRb::DRbBadScheme < DRb::DRbError 
Error raised by a dRuby protocol when it doesn't support the scheme specified in a URI. See DRb::DRbProtocol.

= class DRb::DRbBadURI < DRb::DRbError 
Error raised by the DRbProtocol module when it cannot find any protocol implementation support the scheme specified in a URI.
