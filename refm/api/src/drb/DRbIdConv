= class DRb::DRbIdConv < Object

Class responsible for converting between an object and its id.

This, the default implementation, uses an object's local ObjectSpace
id as its id. This means that an object's identification over drb
remains valid only while that object instance remains alive within the
server runtime.

For alternative mechanisms, see [[c:DRb::TimerIdConv]] in [[lib:rdb/timeridconv]]
and DRbNameIdConv in sample/name.rb in the full drb distribution.

== Instance Methods

#@# bc-rdoc: detected missing name: to_id
--- to_id(obj)

Convert an object into a reference id.
This implementation returns the object's id in the local object
space.

#@# bc-rdoc: detected missing name: to_obj
--- to_obj(ref)

Convert an object reference id to an object.
This implementation looks up the reference id in the local object
space and returns the object it refers to.
